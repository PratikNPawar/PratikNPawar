Hi, I’m Pratik, a Data Analyst with 5+ years of experience transforming data into actionable insights. I’m skilled in Python, SQL, and Power BI, and have a strong track record of improving business operations and decision-making.

At Macan Deve Engineers, I optimized project execution with data analytics, built predictive models, and automated reporting. At Vetro Technologies and Infosys, I developed dashboards and improved data accuracy to support better decision-making.

I also have experience with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and data warehousing tools such as Snowflake and Big Query. I’m passionate about using data to solve problems and drive results. Let’s connect and explore how we can leverage data together!
